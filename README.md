# solana-validator-ha

A gossip-based high availability (HA) manager for Solana validators.

## Demo

A simulated automatic HA failover resulting from `validator-1 (active)` disconnecting from the network given the validator set `[validator-1 (active), validator-2 (passive), validator-3 (passive)]`:

**validator-1** - disconnects, becomes `passive`, and `validator-3` becomes `active`

![demo-validator-1](demo/validator-1/demo.gif)

**validator-2** - detects `validator-1` disconnection, sees `validator-3` take over as `active`

![demo-validator-2](demo/validator-2/demo.gif)

**validator-3** - detects `validator-1` disconnection, takes over as `active`

![demo-validator-3](demo/validator-3/demo.gif)

## Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Peer Detection**: Automatically detects validator roles based on network gossip and RPC identity
- **🛡️ Self-Healing**: Validators transition between active/passive roles based on health and network visibility
- **🔗 Hook System**: Comprehensive pre/post hooks with `must_succeed` support for role transitions
- **📝 Template Support**: Commands and hooks support Go template variables
- **🧪 Dry Run Mode**: Test failover logic without executing actual commands
- **📊 Prometheus Metrics**: Rich metrics collection for monitoring and alerting
- **🌐 Multi-RPC Support**: Multiple cluster RPC URLs for redundancy and load distribution
- **⚡ Throttling Protection**: Smart RPC client load balancing to avoid rate limits
- **🏁 First-Responder Failover**: Race-based failover where fastest healthy passive validator assumes active role when no active validator found in gossip
- **🔧 Integration Testing**: Comprehensive Docker-based integration test suite

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **🎯 HA Manager**: Core logic for monitoring peers and making failover decisions
- **🌐 Gossip Monitor**: Interfaces with Solana gossip network to track validator states
- **📡 RPC Client**: Multi-endpoint RPC client with intelligent failover and throttling protection
- **📊 Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics collection and HTTP endpoint
- **⚙️ Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with validation and templating support
- **🧪 Integration Tests**: Docker Compose-based testing with mock Solana network

### Conceptual overview

`solana-validator-ha` aims to provide a simple, low-dependency HA solution to running 2 or more related validators on a Solana cluster where one of these should be an `active (voting)` peer with the others remaining `passive (non-voting)`. The set of validators each have a unique `passive` identity and a shared `active` identity. The program discovers its HA peers using the Solana cluster's set of validators and each peer makes independent failover decisions when no active peer is discovered.

This approach safeguards against network disconnection or dead nodes, ensuring an `active` validator from the peer list is always online. To this end two (‼️**very**‼️) important user-supplied configuration settings are required:

1. A command to run to assume the `active` role. This is simply a reference to a user-supplied command that will be called on the current node only if a failover is required, the node is healthy, is discoverable on the Solana cluster, and no other peers have already assumed the `active` role. As such it should not return until it has successfully set and confirmed the node is active. Typically this would be something along the lines of:
   
   ```yaml
      #...
      failover:
       active:
         command: "set-identity-with-rollback.sh" # user-supplied command -everyone's setup is different :-)
         args: [
           "--to-identity-file", "{{ .Identities.PassiveKeypairFile }}",
           "--rollback-identity-file", "{{ .Identities.PassiveKeypairFile }}",
         ]
      #...
   ```

2. A command to run to assume a `passive` role (a.k.a _Seppukku_). This is simply a reference to an **idempotent** user-supplied command that ensures the validator is set to `passive`. An `active` validator that detects itself as disconnected from the Solana network will call this independently to ensure it doesn't come back online as `active` and cause duplicate identity atempts. Operators may find it safest to configure validators to always start with a `passive` identity so that this would simply require restarting the validator service and waiting for it to report healthy. Something along the lines of:

   ```yaml
      #...
      failover:
       passive:
         command: "seppukku.sh" # user-supplied command -everyone's setup is different :-)
         args: [
           "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
         ]
      #...
   ```


It is important to note that this does not safeguard against `delinquent` vote accounts. Failing over on these events cannot be guaranteed to fix things.

## Quick Start

air             # Start with hot reloading
```

For Docker-based development:
```bash
make dev        # Start with Docker Compose
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/config -v

# Test with debug mode
TEST_MODE=true go test ./...
```

### Integration Tests

The project includes comprehensive Docker-based integration tests:

```bash
# Run integration tests
make integration-test

# Or directly
cd integration && ./run-tests.sh
```

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Stable Operation**: One active + two passive peers (no failover)
2. **Active Failover**: Active peer disconnects, passive takes over
3. **Race Condition**: Multiple passive peers compete (first responder wins)
4. **Health Validation**: Unhealthy peers don't become active

## Monitoring & Metrics

The application exposes Prometheus metrics on the configured port (default: 9090):

### Core Metrics
- **`solana_validator_ha_metadata`**: Validator metadata with role and status labels
- **`solana_validator_ha_peer_count`**: Number of peers visible in gossip
- **`solana_validator_ha_self_in_gossip`**: Whether this validator appears in gossip (1=yes, 0=no)
- **`solana_validator_ha_failover_status`**: Current failover status

### Metric Labels
- `validator_name`: Configured validator name
- `public_ip`: Validator's public IP address
- `validator_role`: Current role (active/passive/unknown)
- `validator_status`: Health status (healthy/unhealthy)
- Plus any configured static labels

### Health Endpoints
- **`/metrics`**: Prometheus metrics
- **`/health`**: Basic health check

## Failover Logic

The system uses a **first-responder wins** approach:

1. **🔍 Continuous Monitoring**: Poll Solana gossip every `failover.poll_interval_duration`
2. **⚠️ Leaderless Detection**: Trigger if no active peer found for `failover.leaderless_threshold_duration`
3. **🏃 Race Condition**: First healthy passive validator to detect leaderless state wins
4. **⏱️ Takeover Delay**: Brief delay + jitter to reduce collision probability
5. **✅ Health Validation**: Only healthy validators in gossip can become active

## Docker Deployment

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build production image
make docker-build

# Run with custom config
docker run -d \
  --name solana-ha \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  -v /path/to/keypairs:/app/keypairs \
  solana-validator-ha:latest run --config /app/config.yaml
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  solana-ha:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml
      - ./keypairs:/app/keypairs
    command: ["run", "--config", "/app/config.yaml"]
```

## Building for Release

### Automated Releases
The project includes GitHub Actions for automated releases:
1. Create a semantic version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds for all platforms
3. Generates checksums and creates release

### Manual Build
```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Generate checksums
make checksums
```

**Supported Platforms:**
- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (amd64, arm64) 
- Windows (amd64)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Validator not appearing in gossip**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify public IP detection
   - Ensure Solana validator is running

2. **RPC connection failures**
   - Verify `rpc_url` is accessible
   - Check if multiple `rpc_urls` help with redundancy
   - Monitor rate limiting with multiple URLs

3. **Failover not triggering**
   - Check `leaderless_threshold_duration` setting
   - Verify peer configuration
   - Enable debug logging

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug ./bin/solana-validator-ha run --config config.yaml

# Use dry run mode
# Set dry_run: true in config.yaml
```
